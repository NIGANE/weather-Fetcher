trying to fetch weather data for a spicific city using api 
from "https://openweathermap.org" api servicies

it's require to had node at least ^14 installed in ur 
local machine to be able to use this mini_project


after cloning thie mini_project use these commands:

 |- cd  to/where/mini_project/clonned
 |- npm i
  > to donwload all required packages.
 |- ./wheater.js
  > the file is exutable 



if u wanna combine this mini_project into ur personal project u can modify the structuof the project after understanding it well
